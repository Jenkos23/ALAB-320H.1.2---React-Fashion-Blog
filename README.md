# Fashion Blog README

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **Fashion Blog**! This is a simple yet elegant blog design dedicated to showcasing fashionable attire and trends. The blog features various sections, including articles about fashion trends, street style, and vintage fashion. The layout is structured to be visually appealing and easy to navigate.

## Directory Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

```
fashion-blog/
│
├── fashion.html      # Main HTML file for the fashion blog
├── styles.css       # CSS file for styling the blog
```

## HTML Overview

**`fashion.html`**: This is the main HTML document that contains the structure of the blog. It includes:
- A header section with the blog title and navigation links.
- A main section consisting of articles focused on various fashion topics.
- A footer section that includes additional navigation and copyright information.
  
The HTML utilizes elements to ensure accessibility.

### Key HTML Components:

- **Header**: Contains the blog title and navigation links.
- **Main**: Contains sections and articles about fashion-related topics.
- **Footer**: Provides links to related topics and copyright information.

## CSS Overview

**`styles.css`**: This stylesheet defines the visual layout and design of the fashion blog. The following styles have been implemented:

- **Border**: A light gray border on the left side of the page.
- **Body Layout**: The body is centrally aligned, with a maximum width of 1000px and 100% viewport height.
- **Padding**: Added to the header, main, and footer sections to improve spacing and avoid margin collapse.
- **Header Colors**: The `<h1>` element is colored tomato for emphasis.
- **Images**: All images are styled to have a width of 100% for responsive design.
- **Navigation Menu**: The navigation is styled to be a horizontal list with no bullets, using Flexbox for layout, and appropriate colors for link visibility.
- **Article Titles**: Larger font size for the titles of blog posts.
- **Drop Cap**: The first letter of each article's `<p>` tag has a styled drop cap for visual interest.
- **Copyright Text**: The copyright text in the footer is styled in light gray for subtlety.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open `fashion.html` in your preferred web browser to view the blog.
3. To edit or customize, make changes to `fashion.html` for content or `styles.css` for styles.
